# IntelliJ specific instructions
Let's start out with IntelliJ, because I've been told that all the cool kids use IntelliJ, or so they say.  And you do want to be a cool kid, don't you?

If you don't have IntelliJ, grab the Community Edition for free [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html).

Still in your project folder, do:

```
$ git pull upstream idea
```

Then follow the rest of the instructions in the [IntelliJ Guide](Idea.md).

You should have something like this at this point:

Just select the module, then click on 'Run'.
