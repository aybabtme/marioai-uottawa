# MarioAI - uOttawa

## Introduction
Ready to use projects for MarioAI development using Eclipse or IntelliJ.

You will need a Unix/Linux system to follow this guide.  If you run Windows, install [Github for Windows]() and use their provided shell. Otherwise, figure it out yourself :)

# Installation

Using your favourite shell, follow these steps.

1.    Create a folder where you feel your project will grow in happiness.


# IntelliJ specific instructions
Let's start out with IntelliJ, because I've been told that all the cool kids use IntelliJ, or so they say.  And you do want to be a cool kid, don't you?

If you don't have IntelliJ, grab the Community Edition for free [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html).

Still in your project folder, do:

```
$ git pull upstream idea
```

Then follow the rest of the instructions in the [IntelliJ Guide](Idea.md).
